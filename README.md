🩺 Detection and Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an automated system to detect and classify Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal images using deep learning and machine learning techniques. Diabetic Retinopathy is a serious eye disease caused by diabetes that can lead to permanent vision loss if not detected early. This system helps in providing a fast, accurate, and reliable diagnosis to support medical professionals.

🎯 Objectives

Detect Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal images

Classify DR into multiple severity stages

Apply image preprocessing to improve model accuracy

Compare CNN with traditional machine learning models

Build an efficient and automated diagnosis system

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow & Keras

OpenCV

Scikit-learn

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib

🖼 Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into training, testing, and validation sets with five DR categories:

Dataset/
│
├── Train/
│   ├── No_DR/
│   ├── Mild/
│   ├── Moderate/
│   ├── Severe/
│   └── Proliferate/
│
├── Test/
│   ├── No_DR/
│   ├── Mild/
│   ├── Moderate/
│   ├── Severe/
│   └── Proliferate/
│
└── Validation/
    ├── No_DR/
    ├── Mild/
    ├── Moderate/
    ├── Severe/
    └── Proliferate/

🧪 Models Implemented
